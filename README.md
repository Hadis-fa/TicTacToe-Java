🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Java Swing)

📝 Project Description
This project is a GUI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Java Swing. The game is designed for two players, where each player takes turns marking a square in a 3x3 grid with either X or O. The first player to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language.
Java Swing: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).

🛠️ How the Game Works
The game opens a window with a 3x3 grid.
Two players take turns clicking the buttons in the grid.
Player 1 uses X and Player 2 uses O.
The game automatically checks for:
A win condition (three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal).
A draw condition (if the grid is full and no player has won).
Once the game ends, a popup message displays the result:
"X wins!" or "O wins!" if there’s a winner.
"It's a draw!" if the game ends in a tie.
The game board automatically resets after a result is displayed

🧩 Game Logic Explained
The game starts with Player 1 (X).
When a player clicks a button:
If the button is empty, it gets marked with the current player’s icon (X or O).
The turn switches to the other player.
The game checks for a win condition by comparing rows, columns, and diagonals.
If there’s a winner, a popup message displays the result and the board resets.
If the board is full with no winner, a draw message is displayed, and the board resets.
